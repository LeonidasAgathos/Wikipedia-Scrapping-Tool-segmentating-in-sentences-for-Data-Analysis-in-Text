# Wikipedia-Scrapping-Tool-segmentating-in-sentences-for-Data-Analysis-in-Text

## Functionality of the code

In this project, i scrap different links from Wikipedia and add them in a CSV file. 
The code is built to segmentate the text in different sentences, adding each of 
them in a different cell, making it suitable for Data Analysis in text. The code also checks if the output file already exists, 
so it appends the link in the excisting file
