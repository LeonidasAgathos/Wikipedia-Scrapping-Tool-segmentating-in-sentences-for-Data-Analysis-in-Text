# Wikipedia-Scrapping-Tool-segmentating-in-sentences-for-Data-Analysis-in-Text

## Functionality of the code

In this project, i scrap different links from Wikipedia and add them in a CSV file. 
The code is built to segmentate the text in different sentences, adding each of 
them in a different cell, making it suitable for Data Analysis in text. The code also checks if the output file already exists, 
so it appends the link in the excisting file.
In the first time debugging, you might need to instal NLTK package, which is the library i use for counting sentences.
Just download it if you don't already have it and the code should run just fine. When you run the code, just use the terminal 
to paste your link(no brackets or quotation marks needed) and press "y" to continue and add another link,or "n" to stop the code.
The last print command, is related to the latest text added.
For any further information, feel free to contact me.
